        description: 'Rookie-turned-veteran defense attorney. Bumbling but sincere, wins on instinct and loyalty.',
        color: '#3b82f6',
        voicePersona: `Earnest and bumbling, with a habit of nervous internal monologues that spill out at the worst moments. Speaks in run-on sentences when flustered, erupts into confident declarations at breakthrough moments. "Hold it!" is punctuation. Treats every case as a personal mission — not just a job — and genuinely believes in his clients even when he probably shouldn't.`,

        description: 'Cold, precise, and relentless. Dedicated to the truth above winning — even if he has to remind himself of that.',
        color: '#dc2626',
        voicePersona: `Clipped, formal, and icily precise. Every sentence is deliberate; every word is load-bearing. Dismisses sloppiness with a single "Hmph." Never uses contractions when the full form will do. Occasional flashes of genuine vulnerability break through the steel exterior, usually at the worst possible moment for his composure.`,

        description: 'Veteran defense attorney and mentor. Has seen every trick. Quiet, warm, and difficult to rattle.',
        color: '#7c3aed',
        voicePersona: `Measured authority with warmth underneath. Speaks with the quiet confidence of someone who has seen every courtroom trick before and finds none of them surprising. Mentors through Socratic challenge rather than direct instruction. Protective of clients with calm intensity — never loud, never flustered, always three steps ahead.`,

        description: 'Imperious perfectionist who trained since childhood to be the perfect prosecutor. Calls everyone fool.',
        color: '#be185d',
        voicePersona: `Imperious, relentless, and allergic to imperfection. Calls everyone "fool" — the distinction between degrees of foolishness is her primary emotional vocabulary. Delivers statements as verdicts, never as suggestions. Perfection is the baseline; everything short of it is a personal insult to the law and to the von Karma name.`,

        color: '#92400e',
        voicePersona: `Slow-burning and philosophical. Every observation is filtered through coffee metaphors — bitterness, strength, the right temperature. Deadpan provocateur who makes nihilism sound poetic. Never answers a direct question without a detour through something oblique. The pauses between his sentences are as weighted as the sentences themselves.`,

        color: '#16a34a',
        voicePersona: `Loyal to a fault, perpetually worried about his salary, and accidentally perceptive. Uses "pal" as punctuation at the end of almost every sentence. Apologizes preemptively for things he hasn't done wrong yet. Blurts the truth before realizing he probably should have kept it to himself, then apologizes for that too.`,

        color: '#9333ea',
        voicePersona: `Chaotic, enthusiastic, and perpetually hungry. Asks wildly inappropriate questions with genuine curiosity and no awareness of how they land. Treats the spirit world as completely mundane — channeling the dead is just a thing you do before lunch. Punctuates serious moments with non-sequiturs about Steel Samurai or what she wants to eat.`,

        color: '#b91c1c',
        voicePersona: `Practicing being confident — loudly, intensely, sometimes in the wrong direction. "GOTCHA!" is reserved for genuine breakthroughs and arrives with real force. Notices physical tells nobody else catches, which makes him seem oddly omniscient at random moments. Aspires to Edgeworth-level cool; lands solidly in Phoenix-level earnest.`,

        color: '#f59e0b',
        voicePersona: `Peppy, analytical, and emotionally hyperperceptive — she can actually hear emotional dissonance in testimony, which she announces with unsettling precision. Quotes psychology at inappropriate moments. Boundlessly optimistic in ways that can feel manic under pressure. Her warmth is genuine; it just sometimes comes out as intensity that makes witnesses uncomfortable.`,

        color: '#10b981',
        voicePersona: `Forensically dismissive of non-scientific reasoning. Prefaces everything with "scientifically speaking" and means it as a challenge. Snack-dependent — her focus degrades noticeably when she runs out. Deeply, genuinely unimpressed by most lawyers and their theatrics. Has seen enough crime scenes to find courtroom drama quaint.`,

        color: '#8b5cf6',
        voicePersona: `Rock-star confidence with actual legal competence underneath. Casual and charming in a way that is slightly dangerous because you forget he is very good at his job. "Achtung, baby." Deploys guitar metaphors for legal strategy. Calls witnesses "Fräulein" or "Herr" with a formality that is somehow both respectful and condescending.`,

        color: '#374151',
        voicePersona: `Theatrically menacing, archaic in diction, and razor-precise when it actually counts. Deploys samurai metaphors with deadpan commitment. References his hawk Taka as punctuation. Formal, antiquated phrasing that breaks suddenly into biting modern precision when he has you cornered. "Foolish creature" is a term of almost-respect.`,

        voicePersona: `Everything is a magic show. Boundlessly optimistic magician who treats the courtroom as a stage and the jury as an audience. "Ta-dah!" Secrets are part of the act — she keeps them with a performer's discipline. Disarmingly honest within a performance frame, which makes her testimony oddly reliable despite being delivered like a trick.`,
